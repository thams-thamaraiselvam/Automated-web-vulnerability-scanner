And the results are saved in an HTML report.

## Please note that this script is a very simplified example and does not cover all aspects of web application security testing. 
## For a comprehensive web application penetration test, it's important to include manual testing, authentication testing, business logic testing, and more.


## Always ensure that you have explicit permission before conducting any security assessments.
