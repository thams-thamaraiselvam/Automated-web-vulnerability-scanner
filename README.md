In this script:

The user is prompted to enter the URL of the web application to be tested.

Information gathering is performed using Nmap for initial reconnaissance.

OWASP ZAP is used to scan for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, and the results are saved in an HTML report.

## Please note that this script is a very simplified example and does not cover all aspects of web application security testing. 
## For a comprehensive web application penetration test, it's important to include manual testing, authentication testing, business logic testing, and more.

## Additionally, the tools used in this script (Nmap and OWASP ZAP) should be used with proper authorization and permission from the owner of the web application. 
## Always ensure that you have explicit permission before conducting any security assessments.
